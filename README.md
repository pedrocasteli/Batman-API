# Batman-API

A Node.js Back-End application built with Express.js and Mongoose, using MongoDB to store data.

-   The API followed the RESTful pattern using `Express.js`
-   All `.js` files are ES6 native modules

> The data stored in the database was created by me. It was also included as JSON files in the `dev-data` folder.
